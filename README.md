Scraping XFL play-by-play data for use in statistical analysis.

Largely meant to be a project for learning modern Python 3.

- `xflscrapr.txt` is the set of data columns the xflscrapR project outputs in its CSV
- `nflscrapr.txt` is the set of data columns the nflscrapR project outputs in its CSV

Exploded on comma for easy diffing while I set up my own CSV output. <3
