Scraping XFL play-by-play data for use in statistical analysis.

Largely meant to be a project for learning modern Python 3.

In `other_projects_data`, we have text files of the other major projects' data for comparison:
- `xflscrapr.txt` is the set of data columns the xflscrapR project outputs in its CSV
- `nflscrapr.txt` is the set of data columns the nflscrapR project outputs in its CSV
- each one in alphabetical order for easy diffing while I set up my own data
